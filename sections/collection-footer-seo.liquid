<p>Experience Clean, Clear, and Beautiful Skin with Our Face Cleanser
When we say “experience”, we MEAN it. And you can know it too by using your skin type-based face cleanser from our range of cleansing products.
</p>
<h2>What is a face cleanser?</h2>
<p>A face cleanser is a product that is used to cleanse your face and remove any types of impurities, dirt, makeup and dead skin cells. It is also used to remove excess oil and stubborn makeup products that don’t come off easily.
</p>
<h2>Benefits of using face wash:</h2>
<p>They are countless but here are some for you:</p>

<ul class ="sc-footer-seo">
<li>Removes dirt, excess oil and other impurities.</li>
<li>It is the fundamental block of a CTM routine.</li>
<li>Gives an instant freshness and vibrant look to your face.</li>
<li>Helps fight ageing and other skin concerns.</li>
<li>Its regular usage prevents breakouts and clogged pores.</li>
</ul>
  </div>
    <div class="content-box2">
<h2>How to use face cleanser properly?</h2>
<ul class ="sc-footer-sec">
<li>Choose the right cleanser for your skin type: To ensure that your face cleanser works for your face you have to opt for the appropriate one. Skin type-based cleansers are specifically formulated to deliver results to specific skin. So, this should be your first step.
</li>
<li>Take enough time: we often tend to just simply scrub the face cleanser products on our skin and wash it off quickly. The key is to properly massage the face cleanser for around 60 seconds in circular motions so that it does its job properly.</li>
<li>Don’t over-cleanse: Most people with oily skin try to over-cleanse the face by exceeding the cleansing above 60 seconds. This rather triggers the skin and makes it more oily leading to unwanted breakouts. A 30-60 seconds massage would do for all skin types.</li>
<li>Go gentle on your skin: While cleansing makes sure you are gentle with your skin and massage with the right amount of pressure, this way it not removes excess oil, makeup and impurities but also ensures zero irritation.
</li>
<li>Avoid hot water: If you use hot water while rinsing your cleanser you might end up removing skin’s natural barrier and protective oils. It often leads to dryness and irritation as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4 Things to consider before buying face cleanser online:</h2>
<p>With so many face cleansers online, comes an additional responsibility of clearly selecting the best one out there with the right ingredients and a few other parameters which are listed below:</p>

<ul class ="sc-footer-seo">
<li>Know your skin: This cannot be emphasized enough that not just for face cleansers but for any skin care product you need to have a clear understanding of your skin type. If you want to have good results, you ought to be using the right products for your skin.
</li>
<li>Consistency is the key: Now, this reflects the texture of the products that suit your skin type. Cleansers come in foamy, gel-based and thick-cream-based formulations, formulated for different skin types. So, team oily skin should look for gel-based or foamy cleansers and team dry skin for thick-cream cleansers. Normal skin types can sail in any of these boats.</li>
<li>Know your holy grail exfoliators: Again, just when you learn your skin type, the next step should be to know what all would it like to be applied on and play together with to improve your skin. Eg: AHAs’, BHAs’ etc.
</li>
<li>Authentic website: Skin care products change the entire skin game but what if you land on the non-legit ones? It is best to opt for a trusted website or company when you buy face cleansers online.</li>

  <h2>About Gel-Based Moisturizer</h2>
<p>Gel-based moisturizers are extremely lightweight and disappear right after you apply them. This face moisturizer is generally suitable for oily skin types as it helps prevent the building up of dirt and other impurities in the hair follicles by creating a skin barrier. It also helps to trap moisture in the skin and keeps it soft and supple.
</p>
<h2>What does a Moisturizer do?</h2>
<p>Face moisturizers are skin care products that lock in the moisture and nutrients in your face while hydrating the surface layers of your skin. They help improve the skin barrier and prevent early signs of ageing. For a moisturizer to work magically on your skin you will first need to understand your skin type and buy the one that is right for you. 
For example for dry skin, you would need a moisturizer with a thick formula, and for oily skin, gel-based moisturizers work best.
</p>
<h2>How To use face moisturizer properly?:</h2>
<p>Face moisturizer can be used properly in the following manner:</p>

<ul class ="sc-footer-seo">
<li>Always apply a moisturizer on a damp face.</li
 <li>If you follow a skincare regime, layer a moisturizer right after you layer your face with a <a href="https://mycosiq.com/collections/treat">face serum</a>.</li>
<li>Use a tea-dot technique, which has proven better, where you apply the moisturizer in small dots all over your face and then rub it in properly.</li>
<li>Cheeks are usually the driest part of the face, make sure to apply generously and keep rubbing for a few seconds in circular motions.</li>
<li>Do not forget your neck while applying moisturizer or sunscreen to your face.</li>
